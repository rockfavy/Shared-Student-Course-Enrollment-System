# Student Course Enrollment System – Infrastructure Documentation Overview
---
# 1. Overview

The Student Course Enrollment System supports two environments with environment-specific configurations for authentication, database, and deployment.

The platform integrates:

- **Local Environment**: JWT Bearer with symmetric key, in-memory database  
- **Production Environment**: Entra ID (Azure AD), in-memory database  
- HTTP-based communication across all environments  

This overview describes the structure, deployment process, and operational practices used for the Course Enrollment System across all environments.

# 2. Source Control Strategy

The project uses a **monorepo structure** for API, frontend, shared utilities, and documentation.

## Branching Model

The branching model aligns with development workflow:

| Branch Type       | Purpose                                | Deployment Target |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **feature**       | Feature branch (triggers production pipeline) | Production |
| **userstory**    | User story work                        | Local Development |
| **task**         | Task-level work                        | Local Development |
| **main**         | Production-ready                       | Production        |

## Pull Request Rules

All changes enter through PRs, which require:

- Successful build  
- Passing tests (if applicable)  
- Code review approval

# 3. Local Development Setup

## Environment Configurations

### Local Environment
- **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code  
- **Runtime:** .NET 8 SDK  
- **Database:** In-memory (EF Core)  
- **Authentication:** JWT Bearer with symmetric key

### Production Environment
- **Database:** In-memory (EF Core)  
- **Authentication:** Entra ID (Azure AD)  
- **Deployment:** Manual approval required  

## Running the Application

1. Clone repository  
2. Restore dependencies: `dotnet restore`  
3. Start API: `dotnet run --project src/StudentCourseEnrollment.Api`  
4. Start Frontend: `dotnet run --project src/StudentCourseEnrollment.Frontend`  
5. Access application in browser

# 4. Configuration & Settings

## Configuration Storage

- `appsettings.json` → Default configuration  
- `appsettings.Development.json` → Local environment (JWT Bearer with symmetric key)  
- `appsettings.Production.json` → Production environment (Entra ID)  

## Configuration Values

- API URL (for frontend)  
- Database connection (environment-specific)  
- Authentication settings (environment-specific):
  - Local: JWT Bearer with symmetric key configuration
  - Production: Entra ID configuration

# 5. Monitoring & Logging

## Logging

Built-in .NET logging captures:

- HTTP request traces  
- Exceptions  
- Database operations  
- Custom telemetry  

## Development Tools

- Visual Studio debugger  
- Browser developer tools  
- Console logging

# 6. Deployment Considerations

## 6.1 Environment-Specific Deployment

### Local Environment
1. Configure JWT Bearer with symmetric key  
2. Use in-memory database  
3. Run locally for development  

### Production Environment
1. Configure Entra ID (Azure AD) authentication  
2. Use in-memory database  
3. Deploy with manual approval  
4. Configure CORS for API  
5. Set up HTTPS certificates  
6. Configure monitoring and logging
