# Student Course Enrollment System - Migrations & Change Management
---
# 1. Overview

The system uses an in-memory database in all environments (Local, Stage, Production), so migrations are not required.

---

# 2. Current State (In-Memory Database)

## 2.1 No Migrations Required
The in-memory database:
- Is recreated on each application start
- Does not require migrations
- Schema is defined in `OnModelCreating`
- Changes take effect immediately

## 2.2 Schema Definition
Schema is defined in `EnrollmentContext.OnModelCreating`:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    // Configure entities and relationships
}
```

---

# 3. Change Management Process

## 3.1 Schema Changes

For in-memory database:

1. Update entity models
2. Update `OnModelCreating` configuration
3. Test changes locally
4. Update seed data if needed

Changes take effect immediately on application restart.
