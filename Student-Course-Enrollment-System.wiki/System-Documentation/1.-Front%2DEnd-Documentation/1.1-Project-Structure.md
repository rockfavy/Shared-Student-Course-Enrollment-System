# Student Course Enrollment System – Project Structure 
---

# 1. Overview

The Student Course Enrollment System front-end follows the Blazor WebAssembly pattern, organized with feature-based components and clear separation of concerns.

## 1.1 Thin Layer Architecture

The frontend follows a **thin layer architecture** (also called presentation layer or UI layer). This means:

- **Minimal business logic**: The frontend focuses on presentation and user interaction. Business rules and data validation are handled by the API.

- **API delegation**: All business operations are delegated to the Minimal API backend. The frontend acts as a client that:
  - Displays data from the API
  - Captures user input
  - Sends requests to the API
  - Handles API responses and errors

- **Simple structure**: The frontend is organized into:
  - **Components/Pages**: UI rendering and user interaction
  - **Clients**: HTTP communication with the API
  - **Models**: Data transfer objects (DTOs) for API communication
  - **Services**: Minimal state management and UI-specific logic

- **No data persistence**: The frontend doesn't manage data persistence. All data comes from and goes to the API.

- **Stateless where possible**: Components maintain minimal state (form inputs, UI state). Application state is managed through authentication tokens and API responses.

This architecture keeps the frontend simple, maintainable, and focused on its primary responsibility: providing a good user experience.

# 2. Application Structure

The front-end is a Blazor WASM application that communicates with the Minimal API backend via HTTP.

### Test Project Structure

```text
/tests
  /StudentCourseEnrollment.Frontend.Tests
    /Components
      /Pages
      /Layout
      /Shared
    /Clients
    /Models
    /Services
    /TestHelpers
      /TestContext.cs
      /MockHelpers.cs
```

The test project uses:
- **bUnit** for Blazor component testing
- **xUnit** as the test framework
- **Moq** or **NSubstitute** for mocking HTTP clients and services

# 3. Structure Breakdown

## 3.1 Components
Contains Razor components that render the UI.  
Components are organized by feature (Pages) and shared functionality (Layout, Shared).

---

## 3.2 Authorization
Authentication and authorization configuration:

- Authentication setup  
- Authorization handlers  
- Role definitions  

---

## 3.3 Clients
HTTP clients for API communication:

- **CoursesClient** – Course-related API calls  
- **EnrollmentsClient** – Enrollment-related API calls  
- **AuthClient** – Authentication API calls  

---

## 3.4 Models
Frontend data models:

- **Course** – Course information  
- **Enrollment** – Enrollment data  
- **Student** – Student information  
- **CommandResult** – API operation results  

---

## 3.5 Services
Client-side services:

- **EnrollmentState** – Enrollment state management  

---

## 3.6 wwwroot
Static assets:

- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Images  

---

## 3.7 appsettings.json
Configuration for:

- API URL  
- Authentication settings  

---

## 3.8 Program.cs
Bootstraps the application:

- Registers services  
- Configures HttpClient  
- Sets up authentication  
- Configures routing

# 4. Design Principles

The frontend follows established software engineering principles to maintain simplicity, maintainability, and focus.

## SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each component, client, and service has one clear purpose. Pages handle UI, clients handle API communication, services handle state.

- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Components are open for extension (new features) but closed for modification. New features are added as new components without modifying existing ones.

- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Interfaces and abstractions are designed so implementations can be substituted without breaking functionality.

- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Interfaces are focused and specific. Components depend only on methods they actually use.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Components depend on abstractions (clients/interfaces) rather than concrete implementations. Dependencies are injected via `@inject`.

## KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- Keep components simple and focused
- Avoid complex state management unless necessary
- Use Blazor's built-in features (routing, dependency injection, component lifecycle)
- Prefer straightforward solutions over complex patterns

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Extract common UI patterns into reusable components
- Share models and DTOs across related components
- Avoid duplicating validation logic or API call patterns
- Use shared services for common functionality

## YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

- Implement only what's needed for current requirements
- Avoid adding features "just in case"
- Keep the UI layer thin and focused on presentation
- Add complexity only when actual needs arise
