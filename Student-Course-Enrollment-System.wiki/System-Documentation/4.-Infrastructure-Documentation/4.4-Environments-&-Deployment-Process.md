# 1. Overview

Environments and deployment process for the Student Course Enrollment System.

---

# 2. Environments

## 2.1 Local Environment

- **Purpose**: Local development and debugging
- **Database**: In-memory database (resets on restart)
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer with symmetric key (self-issued tokens)
- **Deployment**: Manual (local run)
- **Configuration**: `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json`

### Local Environment Characteristics
- Developers run on their local machines
- In-memory database for rapid iteration
- Self-issued JWT tokens for authentication testing
- Full debugging capabilities
- Hot reload support
- Database resets on application restart

---

## 2.2 Production Environment

- **Purpose**: Live production environment
- **Database**: In-memory database (resets on restart)
- **Authentication**: Entra ID (Azure AD)
- **Deployment**: Manual approval required
- **Configuration**: `appsettings.Production.json`

### Production Environment Characteristics
- Enterprise-grade authentication via Entra ID
- In-memory database
- High availability and scalability
- Monitoring and logging enabled
- Manual deployment with approval gates
- Production-grade security and compliance
- Database resets on application restart

# 3. Deployment Process

## 3.1 Local Development

1. Clone repository
2. Restore dependencies
3. Configure settings
4. Run application

## 3.2 Production Environment Deployment

1. Merge work from `userstory` or `task` branch to `feature` branch
2. `feature` branch automatically triggers production pipeline
3. Build application
4. Run tests
5. Package artifacts
6. **Manual approval required** before deployment
7. Deploy to production environment
8. Verify deployment

# 4. Configuration Management

## 4.1 Environment-Specific Config

- `appsettings.json` → Default configuration
- `appsettings.Development.json` → Local environment (JWT Bearer with symmetric key)
- `appsettings.Production.json` → Production environment (Entra ID)

## 4.2 Secrets Management

- Never commit secrets
- Use configuration management
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
