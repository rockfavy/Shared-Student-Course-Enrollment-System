**User Story:** As a student, I want to see a list of available courses so I can select which to enroll in.

**Actors:** Student, System

**Description / Goal:**  
Student views a list of all available courses with their details (name, description, capacity). This enables the student to browse and select courses for enrollment.

**Preconditions:** None (courses can be viewed without authentication, but enrollment requires authentication).

**Main Flow:**  
1. Student navigates to courses page  
2. System retrieves list of courses from API  
3. System displays courses with details (name, description, capacity)  
4. Student can view course information  
5. Student can initiate enrollment from course list  

**Alternate Flows / Exceptions:**  
- No courses available → system displays "No courses available" message  
- API error → system displays error message  
- Network error → system displays connection error  

**Postconditions:**  
- Student can see available courses  
- Student can select courses for enrollment
