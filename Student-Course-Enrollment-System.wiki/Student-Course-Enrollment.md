## Student Course Enrollment System — System Overview

The Student Course Enrollment System is a Blazor WebAssembly application designed to enable students to register, authenticate, browse available courses, enroll in courses, and manage their course enrollments. The system follows a clean architecture pattern with a Blazor WASM frontend communicating with a Minimal API backend, utilizing in-memory data storage for simplicity and rapid development.

At its foundation, the Student Course Enrollment System follows a feature-based architecture that organizes functionality into clear modules such as Authentication, Courses, and Enrollments. The system operates as a modern web application with a clear separation between the client-side Blazor WASM application and the server-side Minimal API, reducing complexity while maintaining scalability.
